# NYTimesMovieReview
This application is my attempt at Android Architecture Components usage : https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/guide.html 

I wanted to test out AAC and also Kotlin Coroutines using NYTimes API. You will need to register at https://developer.nytimes.com/apis and get your own api key for this app to work.

### Architecture Components
This application implements the following concepts :
- ViewModel
- LiveData
- Room
- Navigation

### Libraries
* [Android Architecture Components][arch]
* [Kotlin Coroutines][coroutines]
* [Dagger 2][dagger2] for dependency injection
* [Retrofit][retrofit] for REST api communication
* [Glide][glide] for image loading
